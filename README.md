# arduinoHwInfo
Arduino controlled hardware monitor
First implementation of arduino for CPU/GPU/FPS monitoring.
Feel free to use my code for you projects.
For the CPU/GPU information I used the https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor project.
For the FPS monitoring I used the https://github.com/spencerhakim/RTSSSharedMemoryNET solution.
For both this projects you can find the x64 dll builded here.
My project is calibrated for a 16 cores, and a 20x4 i2c controller LCD display.
